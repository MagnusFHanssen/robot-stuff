A repository for messing around with trying to simulate joints with motors and loading models using gmlib

In order to clone the gmlib submodule, include the "--recurse-submodules" in the clone command when cloning the project.

A guide to settig up the project can be found [here](https://source.coderefinery.org/gmlib/gmlib1/qmldemo/-/wikis/getting_started "gmlib - getting started").
